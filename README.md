# Welcome to F5 Distributed Cloud

The following resources are intended to get you up and running as soon as possible with some template resources.

To apply these templates to your tenant, please apply them in the following order for best results:

shared-\*, origin-\*.json, and lb-\*.json

Here is how I would apply these templates to a tenant:

[[shared-appfw-blocking.json]]
[[shared-appfw-monitoring.json]]
